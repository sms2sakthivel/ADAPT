# ADAPT
**A**utonomous change **D**etection **A**nd **P**ropagation **T**oolkit  

## Overview  
ADAPT is a framework designed to autonomously detect and propagate changes in interfaces and data formats across interconnected services. It ensures minimal disruptions, enhances system resilience, and streamlines the evolution of complex service ecosystems by automating change management.

---

## Features  
- **Autonomous Change Detection**: Automatically monitors and identifies changes in service interfaces and data formats.  
- **Central Change Registry**: Maintains a log of detected changes for better traceability.  
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts dependent services about relevant changes immediately.  
- **Enhanced Resilience**: Reduces system downtime caused by incompatible changes.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work with various protocols and architectures.  

---

## Use Cases  
1. **Microservices Architectures**: Detect and manage changes in REST, gRPC, or GraphQL APIs.  
2. **DevOps Workflows**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to validate interface compatibility.  
3. **Evolving Services**: Ensure seamless updates across interdependent services.

## Architecture  

ADAPT is composed of the following components:  

1. **Change Detector**  
   - Monitors changes in service interfaces, schemas, or configurations.  
   - Supports protocols like REST, gRPC, and GraphQL.  

2. **Change Registry**  
   - Centralized database to store and manage detected changes.  
   - Provides querying and historical tracking of changes.  

3. **Notification Engine**  
   - Sends real-time alerts to subscribed services.  
   - Integrates with webhooks, messaging queues, and email systems.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- **Programming Language**: Python (or other supported language).  
- **Frameworks**: Flask/FastAPI for backend development.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for the change registry.  
- **Messaging System**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for notifications.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adapt.git
