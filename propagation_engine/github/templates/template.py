The diff should be formatted as a patch file that can be directly applied, committed, and pushed to a feature branch, enabling an automated pull request creation.",

        "1. Parse the provided service-side API change details, including the previous and updated specifications.",
        "2. Identify the removed, modified, or newly introduced attributes, parameters, or response structures.",

        "4. Determine the necessary modifications in the client code to align with the new API specification.",
        "5. Modify the client-side code while ensuring compatibility, maintaining functionality, and preventing errors due to removed or modified fields.",
        "6. Generate a **properly formatted Git diff string**, using the following rules:",
        "   - Use `git diff --unified=3 --no-prefix --binary --ignore-space-at-eol` to ensure correct formatting and context.",
        "   - Ensure **all paths are relative to the repository root**, avoiding absolute paths.",
        "   - Preserve correct indentation, variable names, and structure while eliminating unnecessary changes.",
        "   - Use UTF-8 encoding for the generated diff.",
        "7. **Cross-validate the generated diff** before returning it:",
        "   - Run a **pre-application validation** of the diff using `git apply --check <diff_file>` to ensure no errors are present.",
        "   - If validation fails, **correct the diff string** by fixing any whitespace or line-ending issues and retry.",
        "8. If validation passes, output the generated diff string and related PR details in the expected schema format."
